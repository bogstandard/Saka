## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Saka runs on [Laravel 5.6](https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/installation), and so requires the same:

- PHP >= 7.1.3
- OpenSSL PHP Extension
- PDO PHP Extension
- Mbtype PHP Extension
- string PHP Extension
- Tokenizer PHP Extension
- XML PHP Extension
- CJSON PHP Extension

### Installing

Use Composer to install the application

```
composer install
```


## Built With

* [Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/installation) - The web framework used
* [D3 v4](https://d3js.org/) - Graphics

## Authors

* **Eric D'Addio** - *Initial work* - [BogStandard](https://github.com/BogStandard), [HomePage](http://ericdaddio.co.uk)

## License

This project has No License - see the [No License](https://choosealicense.com/no-permission/) file for details (pretty much: Don't touch until I change this or give you expressed permission)

This will change in future, I'm aware this is a miserable way to have things - I don't like it either.
